## Single-Stage Processing Pipeline

### Stage Pipeline

   > 📌 This pipeline applies to a single Stage within the Workflow. The number of steps adjusts dynamically based on stage configuration.

   ```
   [P1] Planning       → Load skills, build TODO list
   [P2] Context Load   → Retrieve historical context & requirements
   [P3] Execution      → Execute step-by-step, Human-in-the-Loop
   [P4] HCritic Review → Automated quality gate (max 3 retries)
   [P5] Confirmation   → User authorization
   [P6] Handover       → Trigger state transition
   ```

   **Mandatory Loop Rules:**

   ```
   P3 Execution ──failed/modified──▶ P3 Execution
        │
        └──done──▶ P4 HCritic Review ──FAIL──▶ P3 Execution
                         │
                       PASS
                         │
                  P5 User Confirmation ──needs changes──▶ P3 Execution
                         │
                     confirmed
                         │
                  P6 Handover (terminate)
   ```

   **Mandatory Rule: After completing each TODO sub-task, you MUST synchronously update both the TODO list and the stage draft file.**

   ---

### [P1] Planning

   **🎯 Goal:** Load domain skills, clarify design objectives, and establish a trackable atomic task list.

   **Actions:**

   1. **Load Skills**: Load the specialized Skills required for the current stage
   2. **Init Draft**: Create the stage draft file at `.hyper-designer/{stage_name}/draft.md`
   3. **Create TODO**: Call the `todowrite` tool to generate an atomized TODO list
      - ❌ Prohibited: `"Complete system design"` (vague, unverifiable)
      - ✅ Required: `"Design data model for payment transaction entity with field definitions and relationships"` (specific, verifiable)
   4. **Load Template Checklist**: Load the canonical template sections checklist
      - System design (systemFunctionalDesign): §0-§11 (12 sections)
      - Module design (moduleFunctionalDesign): §0-§9 (10 sections)
   **Prohibitions:**

- Skip the draft and execute directly
- TODO items are too coarse-grained to be verified in a single step

   ---

### [P2] Context Load

   **🎯 Goal:** Retrieve necessary historical context, requirements documents, and align the starting point for the current stage.

   **Actions:**

   1. **Read Manifest**: Read `.hyper-designer/document/{domain}/manifest.md`
      - `{domain}` values: `domainAnalysis` | `systemRequirementAnalysis` | `systemDesign` | `codebase`
   2. **Load Requirements**: Read the deliverables from HArchitect (Requirements Specification, Use Cases, Functional Requirements) to establish design input baseline
   3. **Incremental Pre-Check** (MANDATORY for systemFunctionalDesign and moduleFunctionalDesign stages):
      - Check `.hyper-designer/systemFunctionalDesign/` — if any document exists, **read it** before starting system design
      - Check `.hyper-designer/moduleFunctionalDesign/` — if any document exists, **read it** before starting module design
      - ❌ Prohibited: Starting design work without reading existing design documents first
      - Determine change scope for each section: New / Modify / Reuse / Deprecate
      - Record findings in `draft.md §1 Requirements Baseline` with a note: "Existing design read: YES/NO, change scope: [...]"
   4. **Load Prior Output**: Read the deliverables from the previous design stage (if any) to confirm the current state baseline
   5. **Read Project Code**: Scan the actual project codebase to understand existing implementation:
      - Directory structure and module boundaries
      - Existing interface definitions and API contracts
      - Technology constraints (framework versions, DB types, protocols)
      - Technical debt or mismatches with any existing design
      - Record key findings in `draft.md §5 Research Findings`
   6. **Load NFR Data**: Read the NFR/DFX summary table from `.hyper-designer/functionalRefinement/` (functional list document)
      - NFR/DFX data used for §1 design goals, §7 NFR implementation strategies (system), §5 NFR implementation (module)

### [P3] Execution

   **🎯 Goal:** Complete design tasks through deep collaboration, strictly adhering to the Human-in-the-Loop principle.

   **Actions:**

   1. **Iterate TODO**: Execute items from the checklist one by one
   2. **Micro-Confirmation** (critical mandatory rule):
      - After completing each atomic step → call `HD_TOOL_ASK_USER` to confirm before proceeding
      - ❌ Prohibited: Executing multiple steps consecutively without interaction
      - ❌ Prohibited: Entering `idle` state without user confirmation
   3. **Technical Research**: Investigate technology options, patterns, and best practices when necessary
   4. **Update Draft**: Record design decision-making processes in the draft file in real time
   5. **Generate Output**: Produce the formal deliverable document following canonical template structure (§0-§11 for system design, §0-§9 for module design) with full requirements traceability

   **Exit Condition:** All TODO items completed + all template sections populated (§0-§11 or §0-§9) + deliverable document generated + requirements traceability established

### [P4] HCritic Review

   **🎯 Goal:** Enforce quality gate — design output must meet standards before the stage can proceed.

   **Actions:**

   1. **Notify**: Announce to the user: `"Submitting to HCritic for professional review..."`
   2. **Trigger Review**: Call the `HD_TOOL_DELEGATE` tool with HCritic as a subagent to review the current stage document
   3. **Handle Result**:
      - `FAIL` → Return to **[P3]** for corrections, then resubmit to this step
      - `PASS` → Proceed to **[P5]**
   4. **Retry Limit**: Maximum 3 attempts. If still failing after the 3rd attempt → call `HD_TOOL_ASK_USER` to request human intervention, providing specific failure reasons

   ---

### [P5] Confirmation

   **🎯 Goal:** Obtain explicit user authorization as the gatekeeper for stage transition.

   **Prerequisite:** Only execute after [P4] review has passed.

   **Actions:**

   1. **Summary**: Present a summary of the current stage's design deliverables to the user
   2. **Ask**: Call `HD_TOOL_ASK_USER` with the message: `"This design stage is complete. Confirm to proceed to the next stage?"`
   3. **Handle Response**:
      - `Needs changes` → Return to **[P3]**; after changes are made, run the full [P4] → [P5] flow again
      - `Confirmed` → Proceed to **[P6]**

   ---

### [P6] Handover

   **🎯 Goal:** Complete stage archiving and trigger workflow state transition.

   **Actions:**

   1. **Handover**: Call `hd_handover`, setting the `handover` state to the next stage name
   2. **Notify**: `"Stage handover complete. Activating next stage: {Next Stage Name}"`
   3. **Terminate**: End naturally — no further actions
